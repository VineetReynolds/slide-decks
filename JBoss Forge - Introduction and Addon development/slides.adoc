Let's talk about [blocktext]#*productivity*#

.Every one wants development to be simple.

[{hidecaption}]
.Some expect to learn one language, a few APIs, maybe one framework, and meet all demands with a limited set of primitives.

== !

[{hidecaption}]
.But in reality - One language is hardly sufficient. APIs are numerous. Frameworks are dime a dozen.

.And it takes time to discover best practices relevant to your development stack.

.Achieving expertise is not easy. It takes time.

== Speaking of Forge...

* Aids in _automation_ of _repetitive tasks_.
* Performs _generation_ of _boilerplate code_.
* Helps you focus on _business-centric activities_.
* Available as an _Eclipse plugin_ and a _CLI tool_.
** for now...

[{hidecaption}]
.Scaffold an application

[.topic.source]
== Looking back...

* Forge commands can _consume_ the _output_ of others
** Goes beyond offerings from Maven archetypes etc.
* Forge is not _constrained_ to any _framework_.
** Very much unlike tools tied to frameworks.


[.topic.source]
== Looking back...
* It offers productivity to _beginners_ and _experts_ alike.
** Caters to _IDE_ and _command-line_ users.
* It provides _'sugar'_ at a higher level than _language constructs_.
** Productivity is not limited by requiring you to be aware of _"syntactic sugar"_.
** "I need a persistence layer" vs "I need to declare a property"

.Engineer your workflow. Write your own addons

[.topic.recap]
== Recap

JBoss Forge :

* can _automate_ common development _tasks_
* allows you to _extend_ it's _behavior_
** with a _simple_ programming _model_
* _without constraining_ you to a specific _environment_
